HTML
Markup that describes content and structure of the document

ELEMENT

Elements are expressed using opening and closing tags:

<ELEMENT>content</ELEMENT>

<B><U>content</U></B> <- always nest elements

<B><U>content</B></U> <- won't work

<INPUT type="checkbox" name="fullname" checked />

Attributes are data that belong to an element that are not part of the element's content

Attributes ALWAYS are placed in the opening tag

<a href="http://google.com">Go to Google</a> <-- correct

<a>Go to Google</a href="http://google.com"> <-- won't work

Some elements do not require an explicit closing tag. These are called "self-closing" or "void" tags.

Best practice is to put a slash just before the ending > bracket:

<INPUT type="text" />
                   ^--- Marks this as a self-closing element

Links (Anchor A element)

Two types of links:
Links to external pages
Links to specific location in a page

<a href="TARGET_URL">Click to follow link</a>

Use target="_blank" to open a new tab


Absolute vs Relative URLs/URIs

Absolute URL is a complete URL, like http://www.embassyeritrea.org/id_cards.htm

	1. Protocol (http://)
	2. Domain (www.embassyeritrea.org)
	3. Path (/)
	4. Filename (id_cards.htm)

Example: <a href="http://www.embassyeritrea.org/id_cards.htm">ID Cards</a>

Relative URLs are incomplete

Example: <a href="id_cards.htm">ID Cards</a>


Links to specific locations in a page

What you're actually doing is linking to a specific element

1. Give the target element an id

2. Reference the element's id in the href using #id

CSS
---

CSS is based on rules that get applied to element nodes in the DOM.

Basic style rule syntax:

selector {
	property: value;
	property: value;
	...
}

Example: 

p {
	color: black;
}

Three ways to apply CSS in an HTML document:

1. Inline style - Uses style attribute to attach properties directly to an element

2. Embedded stylesheet - A style sheet local to the HTML document using the STYLE element

3. External stylesheet - Stylesheet is in a separate document that is attached to the HTML document


Color codes
Red, green, blue value range 0-255 (decimal), #00-#FF (hexadecimal)

color: red;
color: #FF0000;  RRGGBB
color: rgb(255, 0, 0); 	R, G, B
color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1); 	R, G, B, A 

Alpha channel is transparency; values are from 0 (transparent) to 1 (opaque)

Identifying elements

Unique - Assign an id using id attribute
Groups - Assign a group name using class attribute

CSS Selectors

Three common selectors:

Element - p, h1, span, etc.
ID - #id
Class - .classname

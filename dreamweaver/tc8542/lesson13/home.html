<p>“We are such spendthrifts with our lives, the trick of living is to slip on and off the planet with the least fuss you can muster. I’m not running for sainthood. I just happen to think that in life we need to be a little like the farmer, who puts back into the soil what he takes out.” </p>

<figcaption>Most trips away from home are less than 5 miles. Thirty-five percent of all fossil fuels are burned going to and from work and shopping for dinner and other short trips. By using your bike for commuting or local errands, you can save hundreds of dollars a year and help the planet. It's also good for you, too.

Fun with queries...

SELECT count(id) AS count_dmg
FROM dmr
WHERE incident_date BETWEEN '2018-12-01' AND '2018-12-07'

SELECT SUM(stops) AS total_stops
FROM dispatch
WHERE delivery_date BETWEEN '2018-12-01' AND '2018-12-07'

SELECT DISTINCT 
(SELECT count(id) AS count_dmg
 FROM dmr 
 WHERE incident_date BETWEEN '2018-12-01' AND '2018-12-07')  /
(SELECT SUM(stops) AS total_stops
 FROM dispatch
 WHERE delivery_date BETWEEN '2018-12-01' AND '2018-12-07') * 100
as result

SELECT

    <h1>Google Launches Google Diary</h1>
    <h2>Searchable Index of Innermost Secrets  a &quot;Breakthrough&quot;</h2>
    <p>In a continued effort to put the world's information online, Google has  announced the launch of Google Diary. Google is digitizing every diary in the world, including yours, and putting them online for the world to see. 
      Every single private word anyone has ever written, from the banal to the embarrassing, is now instantly searchable. &quot;You'll never have to worry about your sibling stealing your diary and reading through it, because Google has already done it for them! We've written special search algorithms so that the most embarrassing and personal sections will be listed towards the top so that they are more widely read,&quot; says Google CEO Larry Page.    Soon to follow are Google Thought, Google Nuclear Secrets and Google  Identity Records.</p>
    <h1>Green Utensils</h1>
    <p>Meet the environmentally friendly eating utensil: the spork! Think of the resources consumed in the manufacturing process of forks and spoons. A spork serves both purposes yet requires half the materials and energy to make. If thrown away they
      take up less space in landfills. But of course sporks can be made out of recyclable materials such as plastics or metal. I know fine dining establishments would balk at the idea of setting out just one spork (hey, they use many forks and spoons!),
      but they would be doing the environment a favor. Think of the water and energy they would save when dishwashing. Raise your spork if you agree.</p>

    <h1>Sporktown Voters Go To The Polls</h1>
    <p>Sporktown, USA: Sporktownâ€™s hotly contested mayoral race is about to come to a dramatic close as the polls open today. Voters are sharply divided on the issue of which side of the plate to put the spork on. Should it go on the left where the fork traditionally has gone, or should it be on the right? With each candidate claiming a slim margin of 1%, both parties admit the race will be close. &quot;Ted Skillern has fought quite a campaign over the last 9 months, but I think ultimately voters will vote with their conscience and realize that sporks should go on the right,&quot; says mayoral candidate Patrick Shoop. Of course Mr. Skillern,  sharply disagrees. &quot;Before the spork, the fork was the main utensil on the table and was <em>always </em>on the left. You have to be on the left of the plate to be in charge, and it is the spork's destiny to assume its place at the head of the table.&quot; Polls close today at 7:30pm.</p>

    <h2>This Local News Is Done</h2>
    <p>Our Newsroom, USA: As of now, right this very minute, I have completed writing the news for this local section. Everything is completely current and up-to-date. It happened just this second, on the dot.  I had lots of writing and stories to cover, then all at once I was done. At the moment there's nothing left to cover. It all happened so fast, almost instantly. This kind of thing happens now and again, once in a blue moon, every so often, sometimes, occasionally, in due course, and by and by, but then again in this present climate of news journalism you never know. Let me tell you, it feels good for a reporter to be done with a day's work.  Overall I guess I'm trying to say that when it comes to writing local news I am presently finished.</p>

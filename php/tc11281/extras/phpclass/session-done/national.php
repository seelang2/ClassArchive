    <h1>Million Spork March Planned</h1>
    <h2>Spork Supporters to Protest at Capital</h2>
    <p>Washington, DC: In order to raise awareness for their cause, and to give equal usage for sporks, the ASLU (American Spork Liberties Union) has announced that it will plan a &quot;Million Spork March&quot; on Washington. Stephen Frank, spokesperson for the ASLU, sees the debate on spork usage as a civil rights issue: &quot;Why shouldn't we be allowed to use sporks? Isn't a person's choice in utensil a private matter? Shouldn't we tolerate all utensils and allow people to make their own choice. Too long have sporks been relegated to mere plastic makeshift picnic items. I dream of a day where there is a spork in every fancy restaurant in the nation.&quot;</p>
    <p>On the other side of the debate, some claim that spork usage is a moral issue. &quot;If God intended there to be sporks he would not have made the fork and the spoon,&quot; says Janet Jacobson leader of the FFFF (Family Foundation For Forks). &quot;If you allow sporks at the table, what's next, eating with your hands? Using two sporks at once? Is this how we want our children to be raised?&quot;</p>
    <p>The President and DC local officials have not yet commented on what actions they will take regarding the march.</p>
    <h1>New President Elected</h1>
    <h2>And All I Got Was a This Lousy Website</h2>
    <p>Washington, DC: The new president's first order of business will be to &quot;completely overhaul and redesign&quot; the nation's website. &quot;Just look at those ugly colors and clunky graphics,&quot; said Mr. President. &quot;I mean, can you believe that JPEG compression? And they still use the font tag!&quot; said the leader of the free world. The President has called an emergency session of Congress, where he will seek funding for new fonts, use of div tags, CSS, flashier Flash and overall cleaner code. &quot;As the face of the US to the world, the website is extremely important, maybe more important than any other issue we face. Just look at that old [site]....ugh, it just reminds me of the 90s. Something must be done.&quot;</p>

    <h1>Russia Tests US Spork Dominance</h1>
    <h2>Launch in the Barents Sea Could Pose Threat to US Sporks</h2>
    <p>Moscow, Russia: Russian scientists claim they are hot on the tail of America with their own improved version of the spork,  the Skadle. The Skadle is over ten times more powerful than the spork, as it combines a ladle and a skewer.

    <h1>Osama Bin Laden Found OnÂ Facebook</h1>
    <h2>Friend Request Reveals Location</h2>
    <p>Kabul, Afghanistan: The long search for Osama Bin Laden appears to be over as authorities were alerted to the location of Osama Bin Laden when high schooler Jenny Cho, 16, received a &quot;You're a Hottie&quot; request from the terrorist mastermind. &quot;Of course I didn't add him as a friend. Being stalked by that creepy old guy is, like, so embarrassing,&quot; says Miss Cho. Government officials have been criticized for missing such an obvious place to look, but contend that his profile was set to &quot;private.&quot;</p>

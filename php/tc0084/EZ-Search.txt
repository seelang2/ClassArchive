For a project I recently worked on I needed to make a full text search engine -- a prospect I know 'all too well' having built a number of these in the past.

I usually end up making full text search with separate word indexe tables (so that I can add special weightings to different words found in different parts of the document and also so that I can do porter stemming etc). Along with that comes things like cron driven search index update scripts, etc. (to maintain the system).

This time I decided to do a little research into mySQL to see if the full text search was any faster than the last time I looked (about 4 years ago), last time I looked at it was too slow and not a viable option.

This time round, after a bit of digging, I came up with the following fully weighted full text search engine with hardly any lines of code at all :)

Lovely if your lazy!!!

Best thing is it seems to be returning results from a million row table in less than a second (on my local machine).

So here it is. A quick, weighted, full text search engine, for lazy sods (in mySQL). Enjoy.

(Requires ezSQL)


      // Table structure
      CREATE TABLE stories
      (
      story_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      category VARCHAR(255),
      title VARCHAR(255),
      body TEXT,
      FULLTEXT (title,category,body),
      FULLTEXT (title),
      FULLTEXT (category),
      FULLTEXT (body),
      PRIMARY KEY (story_id)
      )

      // Incoming search
      $query = "this is my search";

      // Main query
      $db->get_results("
      SELECT
      *,
      (MATCH (category) AGAINST ('$query' IN BOOLEAN MODE)*100) +
      (MATCH (title) AGAINST ('$query' IN BOOLEAN MODE)*10) +
      MATCH (body) AGAINST ('$query' IN BOOLEAN MODE) AS rating
      FROM
      stories
      WHERE
      MATCH (title,category,body) AGAINST ('$query' IN BOOLEAN MODE)
      ORDER BY
      rating DESC
      LIMIT 0,10
      ");

Note 1: 'category' is weighted as 100 times more important than 'body'. 'title' is weighted as 10 times more important than 'body'. Tweak as required.

Note 2: It requires a 'big' data set to work nicely

Note 3: mySQL ignores search terms of 4 chars or less by default

Note 4: Try removing 'IN BOOLEAN MODE' (all instances). The results 'might' be more accurate.

Note 5: Does not include porter stemming.
